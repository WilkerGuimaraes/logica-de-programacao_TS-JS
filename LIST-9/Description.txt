Write a class that has an attribute of type integer named n1 and a method called `printNumber()` to print 
the value of n1. Create a subclass of this class that also has an attribute of type integer named n2 and 
override the method of the superclass to print the value of n2. Then create a main class that has an object 
of the subclass and use it to assign values to n1 and n2. Afterward, call the `printNumber()` method using 
this object and analyze the result.
