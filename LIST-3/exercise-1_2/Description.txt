1- Develop a program for a company, which intends to control how many
employees exist in the company. (registration number, name, age, salary). Registration would be
static attribute of the class to generate an incremental number whenever a new
employee is registered.

2- Improve the program in question 1, assigning a work sector to each
employee. The sector would consist of a code and a name. So each employee
would now have an object from the sector to which it was allocated.
Assumptions of the Setor class: In addition to the code and name, the Sector class would have an attribute
static to perform a count of created sectors; The static attribute when being
incremented, I would pass this value to the code attribute that is not static in order to
save the value that was increased. At this point you should also receive the name
of the Sector and save it in the sector name attribute. Finally, when printing the data from the
employee, you must also print the code and name of the sector in which the employee
was allocated, exactly as follows:
