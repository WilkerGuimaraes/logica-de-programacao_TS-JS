Create an abstract class 'Person' that has a private 'name' attribute, a public constructor,
a 'get' method for the attribute, and an abstract method 'getDescription'.

Create a class 'Employee' that inherits from the abstract class 'Person'.This class will have the 'name' 
attribute from the superclass and a private 'salary' attribute.

It will have methods 'getSalary' that returns the salary and 'getDescription' that returns the name 
and salary. It will also have an 'updateSalary' method with a 'byPercentage' argument of type double
that will adjust the salary: salary * byPercentage/100 and update the salary.

Create a 'Student' class that inherits from the abstract class 'Person'.This class passes the name to 
the superclass constructor and has a private String attribute for the study area.It will have a 
'getDescription' method that returns the student's name and study area.

Finally, create a 'PersonTest' class to test the 'Person' class. Instantiate the 'person' object as 
an array of two positions. Fill the 'person' array with 'Student' and 'Employee' objects.
Then, print the names and descriptions of all 'Person' objects.
Note: For 'Employee' objects, display the data as name and salary; for 'Student' objects, display name 
and study area.
