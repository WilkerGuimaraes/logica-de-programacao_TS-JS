Create an abstract class `MathematicalOperation`. This class should implement basic operations
(addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication). Create an abstract method `calculate` with two 
double arguments.

Create a class `Addition` that inherits from the abstract class `MathematicalOperation` and generates a 
method that returns the sum of the two numbers.

Create a class `Subtraction` that inherits from the abstract class `MathematicalOperation` and generates 
a method that returns the subtraction of the numbers.

Finally, create a class `Accounts` that has a static method `showCalculation` that takes an object of type 
`MathematicalOperation` as well as two numbers as parameters. Print the calculation result.

To demonstrate polymorphism, make a call through the `showCalculation` method by instantiating an
`Addition` object and passing two parameters.

Following the previous item, make another call to the method, but this time for subtraction.
