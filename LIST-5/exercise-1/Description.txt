// Write the classes as follows:

Write the classes as follows:

a- A class called Person, with attributes name (type String) and lastName (type string). Each of these attributes must have methods to read and modify (getters and
setters). The Person class must also have a method called getFullName that takes no input parameters and returns the concatenation of the name attribute 
with the lastName attribute. Additionally, the class should have a constructor with no parameters and another constructor that receives the name and 
lastName as parameters and respectively modifies the name and lastName attributes.

b- A subclass called Employee. The Employee class should have attributes registrationNumber (type int) and salary (type double), with their respective methods 
for reading and modification (getters and setters). An employee's salary must never be negative. Every employee receives their salary in two installments, with 
60% in the first installment and 40% in the second installment. Thus, write the methods getSalaryFirstInstallment that returns the value of the first installment of the salary (60%) and 
getSalarySecondInstallment that returns the value of the second installment of the salary (40%).

c- A subclass of Employee called Professor. Every professor receives their salary in a single installment. Thus, it is necessary to override the methods 
getSalaryFirstInstallment and getSalarySecondInstallment. The getSalaryFirstInstallment method of the Professor class should return the full value of the professor's salary 
and the getSalarySecondInstallment method should return zero.

d- Create a class UsePerson that instantiates the following objects:
Person 1(Person)
name: Jos√©
lastName: Manoel

Person 2(Employee)
name: Leandro
lastName: Charles
salary: 2000.00

Person 3(Professor)
name: Rita
lastName: Cassia
salary: 500.00

Then perform the following operations following the sequence of orders:

e- Display the output of the getFullName method for all 3 objects.
f- Display the output of the getSalaryFirstInstallment and getSalarySecondInstallment methods for the objects in items person2 and person3.
