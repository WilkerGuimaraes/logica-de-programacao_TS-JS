Implement the following classes:
a- A class named Transport with attributes 'turnedOn' (boolean type) and 'speed' (int type), and methods 'turnOn' and 'turnOff'. 
The 'turnOn' method sets 'turnedOn' to true, and the 'turnOff' method sets 'turnedOn' to false, also setting 'speed' to zero. 
Additionally, create getter and setter methods to modify the 'speed' attribute, ensuring that the speed cannot be negative.

b- A subclass of Transport called Car. Car should have the attribute 'mileage' (int type) and the necessary methods to read and write (getters and setters). 
The mileage cannot be negative or exceed the value of 999999. The Car's speed cannot be negative or exceed 200.
