Implement the following program for equipment control:

a- Implement a class called Equipment with an attribute 'on' (boolean type) and 
methods 'turnOn' and 'turnOff'. The 'turnOn' method sets the 'on' attribute to true, 
and the 'turnOff' method sets the 'on' attribute to false.

b- Implement a class called SoundEquipment that inherits the characteristics of 
Equipment and has attributes 'volume' (short type) ranging from 0 to 10, and 
'stereo' (boolean type). The class should also have methods to read and modify 
the volume (getters and setters), as well as methods 'mono' and 'stereo'. The 'mono' 
method sets the 'stereo' attribute to true. When turning on the sound equipment 
via the 'turnOn' method, its volume is automatically set to 5.
