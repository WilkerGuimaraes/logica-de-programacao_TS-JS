Here's the translation of the provided text:

• Create a TypeScript program that implements the scenario considering the composition between classes:

Composition ---♦

Manufacturer Class ---♦ Car Class ---♦ Fleet Class
Manufacturer Class ---♦ Tire Class ---♦ Car Class
Manufacturer Class ---♦ Truck Class ---♦ Fleet Class
Manufacturer Class ---♦ Gear Type Class ---♦ Gear Class ---♦ Truck Class
Manufacturer Class ---♦ Body Class ---♦ Truck Class
Engine Class ---♦ Car Class
Engine Class ---♦ Truck Class

Attributes:

Car Class { + model: string, + licensePlate: string}
Engine Class { + power: number, + chassis: string, + torque: number}
Manufacturer Class { + name: string, + cnpj: string}
Tire Class { + diameter: number, + measures: number}
Truck Class { + model: string, + licensePlate: string, + doubleCab: boolean}
Fleet Class { + name: string, + type: string, + responsible: string}
Gear Type Class { + transmission: string}
Gear Class { + quantity: number}
Body Class { + bodyType: string}

• Finally, create a class called Principal to use the objects according to the planned composition.
