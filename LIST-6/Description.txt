Here's the translation of the provided text:

• Create a class called Vehicle, which will contain the following private attributes: chassis (String), type
(car or bicycle - String), maxSpeed (number), and cont (number) as static. This class should have a
constructor that initializes all attributes and increments this counter (cont).

Add to the Vehicle class the following methods:
• getters/setters for all attributes;
• clean: a public method that, when called, prints the following message: "The vehicle
VEHICLE_TYPE", with CHASSIS is being cleaned;
• adjust: a public method that, when called, prints a message saying: "The vehicle
VEHICLE_TYPE", with CHASSIS is being adjusted;
• incrementSpeed: a public method that receives an integer value and adds this integer to
the maxSpeed of the vehicle and prints a message saying: "The vehicle VEHICLE_TYPE",
with CHASSIS now has a maxSpeed of km/h.

• Create two subclasses for Vehicle:
• One called Bicycle, which will have the private attribute nrGears (number);
• One called Car, which will have the private attribute fuel (number).
Create for both subclasses a constructor that initializes all attributes. Remember that since they
inherit from Vehicle, they also have the attributes that Vehicle has.

Add to the Car class the following method:
• changeOil: a public method that prints a message saying: "The vehicle VEHICLE_TYPE, with CHASSIS changed
the oil".

In the Bicycle class, the following method:
• increaseGear: a public method that receives an integer and adds this integer to the nrGears of
the bicycle. In addition, it increases the speed of the bicycle by calling the superclass method
(incrementSpeed), and passes the resulting integer value of the expression: ((nrGears of
the bicycle/superclass maxSpeed)*100). At this point, the superclass method
will report the new speed.

• Create a VehicleTest class with a main method, and create 3 Bicycles and 2 Cars in a way that always
keeps track of the quantity of vehicles being created. Then call the adjust and clean methods
of these objects. Also, call the increaseGear method for objects that are of type Bicycle and pass
some different value. Now call the increase speed method for Car objects. Call the change oil method
for Car objects. Finally, obtain the quantity of vehicles that were created.
